# Selenium::Client

WC3 Standard selenium client

Automatically spins up/down drivers when pointing at localhost and nothing is already listening on the provided port

Working Drivers:

* Gecko
* Chrome
* MicrosoftEdge
* Safari

Also can auto-fetch the SeleniumHQ JAR file and run it.
This feature is only tested with the Selenium 4.0 or better JARs.

Also contains:

- Selenium::Specification

Module to turn the Online specification documents for Selenium into JSON specifications for use by API clients

Soon to come:

- Selenium::Server

Pure perl selenium server (that proxies commands to browser drivers, much like the SeleniumHQ Jar)

- Selenium::Grid

Pure perl selenium grid API server

- Selenium::Client::SRD

Drop-in replacement for Selenium::Remote::Driver

## Care and feeding

This module stores a number of things in your homedirectory's .selenium folder.
You may want to clear this out periodically, as various log files and configuration data becomes stale.

## BUILDING

This is a Dist::Zilla CPAN module.  To build this project, do the following:

* Install Dist::Zilla either via cpan or your favorite package manager

`dzil authordeps --missing | sudo cpanm`
`dzil listdeps   --missing | sudo cpanm`
`dzil build`

## TESTING

To check how this works with your setup, install Selenium::Client from CPAN (or just clone this repo), and then run:

`prove -vm -Ilib at/sanity.test`

This runs through 100% of the WC3 selenium API.
At release it passed on all of the supported browsers on:

* Windows 10
* OSX 10.13
* Ubuntu Linux (focal)

Please file a bug report on this repository's tracker if you get a NOT OK that isn't already in a SKIP or TODO block.
